\section{Nash equilibrium}
	Nash equilibrium is a concept in game theory where the game reaches an optimal outcome. This is a state that gives individual players no incentive to deviate from their initial strategy. The players know their opponentâ€™s strategy and still will not deviate from their initial chosen strategies because it remains the optimal strategy for each player.
